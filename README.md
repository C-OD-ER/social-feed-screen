# Social feed single page application using React
Overview:  The development of a single page application that displays a social feed listing screen using React. The application was designed to provide users with an easy-to-use platform for viewing and posting social content, with features such as post attachments, automatic text area expansion, and responsive design for compatibility across devices.
I implemented a range of features, including text message posting with optional attachments, automatic text area expansion, and audio recording playback controls.
The UI was developed using Sass for CSS styling, with variables used for colors, font size, and formatting. Font Awesome icons were used for visual elements, and browser local storage was utilized for data storage.
The social feed listing screen includes fixed and scrolling panels, with cards displaying varying name, image, duration, and content. The UI is fully responsive and compatible with both web and mobile devices.
Users can post messages with attachments, including photos captured using the device camera, and audio recordings with playback controls. The text area for composing messages automatically expands in height up to five lines, with a vertical scroll beyond that.
